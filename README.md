## Prepare

Make a copy of `.env.example`, name it `.env`, and add values for the listed environment variables. (API seemed to work even without token, at least locally, but it might not be always true).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `yarn start` - development mode on `http://localhost:8080`
-   `yarn build` - builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
-   `yarn lint` - lints the project.
-   `yarn test` - runs tests with Playwright
